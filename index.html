<p>Leith Hill is one of southern England's <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/leith-hill" target="_blank">best loved</a> Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. A decade ago the Forestry Commission, who are supposed "<a href="https://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-6val65" target="_blank">to protect and expand forests and woodlands and increase their value to society and the environment</a>", inexplicably decided to lease Bury Hill Wood on Leith Hill to be drilled for oil by Europa Oil and Gas. For the last nine years, the local community has campaigned tirelessly to protect our beloved hill from this proposal.</p>

<p>During the summer just passed, a local mother and baby group had the idea of doing some Gruffalo-themed family protest events, as the Forestry Commission had recently been promoting Gruffalo-branded activities in places such as Alice Holt forest. The group were pretty sure that Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler would be dismayed if they knew what their wonderful creation was indirectly helping to promote.</p>

<p>Also at that time, a local dad and musician was pondering how to finish off a woodland musical instrument project for his kids using a hollow tree trunk section that had been sitting in their shed. Inspired by the mother and baby group, he decided to make it into a pedal-steel style <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tree-guitar">tree guitar</a>, and one Saturday evening shortly thereafter with the help of a bottle of wine he used it to write Gruffalo Blues.</p>

<p>Various recording sessions were then held in Dorking and the surrounding areas, including church hall drop-in events for anyone wishing to come along and have a sing. Out of these sessions, the Leith Hill Community Blues Band was born. "<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/song">Gruffalo Blues (Save Leith Hill)</a>" is the result of our efforts.</p>

<p>Our hope is that our song might eventually reach the ears of Julian Donaldson and Axel Scheffler, and in listening to it they will reconsider their partnership with the Forestry Commission. We also hope to raise as much awareness as possible about other Forestry Commission locations around the country such as Sherwood Forest which are also fighting the same threat.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we hope you enjoy listening to it!! If you do, then we'd be really, really grateful if you could please share it with as many of your friends as possible!</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>The Leith Hill Community Blues Band</p>
