<p>We need <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-help"><strong>your help</strong></a> to get our song to Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler!! We hope the Gruffalo will join us in reminding the Forestry Commission that they need "<a href="https://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-6val65" target="_blank">to protect and expand forests and woodlands and increase their value to society and the environment</a>" rather than selling them off to oil drilling companies.

<p>Leith Hill is one of southern England's <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/leith-hill" target="_blank">best loved</a> Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. A decade ago the Forestry Commission decided to lease Bury Hill Wood on Leith Hill to Europa Oil and Gas to be drilled for oil. For the last nine years, the local community has campaigned tirelessly to protect our beloved hill from this proposal. During last summer, a local mother and baby group had the idea of doing some Gruffalo-themed family protest events. Inspired by this, a Dorking dad decided to finish off a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tree-guitar">woodland musical instrument project</a> for his kids, and one evening with the help of a bottle of wine he used it to write Gruffalo Blues. Recording sessions were held locally including drop-in events for anyone wishing to come along and sing. Out of these sessions, the Leith Hill Community Blues Band was born and "<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/song">Gruffalo Blues (Save Leith Hill)</a>" created.</p>
