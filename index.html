<p>The Forestry Commission owns Bury Hill Wood on Leith Hill, one of southern England's best loved Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Despite its corporate mission statement <a href="https://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-6val65">"to protect and expand forests and woodlands and increase their value to society and the environment"</a>, in 2008 the Commission inexplicably decided to lease Bury Hill Wood to Europa Oil and Gas for the purposes of oil drilling. For the last nine years, the local community has campaigned tirelessly to protect our beloved hill from this proposal.</p>

<p>During the summer just passed, a local mother and baby group had the idea of doing some Gruffalo-themed family protest events: the Forestry Commission had recently been promoting Gruffalo-branded activities at locations such as Alice Holt forest. The group were sure that Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler would be appalled if they knew what their wonderful creation was indirectly helping to promote.</p>

<p>At the same time, a local musician dad was pondering how to finish off a woodland musical instrument project for his kids using a hollowed out silver birch tree trunk that had been sitting in their shed. Inspired by the mother and baby group, he decided it could be fun to make it into an electric pedal-steel style guitar to be used in Gruffalo-related family campaign activities. The result was the <a href="/tree-guitar">tree trunk guitar</a>.</p>

<p>One Saturday evening shortly thereafter, fueled by a bottle of wine, a slide bottleneck and a looper pedal, he wrote the song which has become Gruffalo Blues.</p>
