<h3>Backgrounder</h3>

<p>Leith Hill is one of southern England's best loved Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. A decade ago the Forestry Commission decided to lease Bury Hill Wood on Leith Hill to Europa Oil and Gas to be drilled for oil. In 2011, Surrey County Council refused permission for a planning application to explore there for oil. The decision was appealed, and the subsequent public inquiry in July 2012 upheld the refusal. That decision was then challenged in the High Court, which found favour with Europa resulting in a second public inquiry. This unfortunately coincided with a change in the planning regulations, and as a result the government planning inspectorate decided to grant permission providing that Europa could fulfill 23 planning conditions. They are now in the process of attempting to discharge those conditions.</p>

<p>For the last nine years, the local community has raised over Â£100K, mounted multiple legal challenges and campaigned tirelessly to protect their beloved hill from this proposal. Last summer, a local mother and baby group had the idea of doing some Gruffalo-themed family protest events, as the Forestry Commission had been promoting Gruffalo-branded activities at other locations including Alice Holt forest. Inspired by this, a local musician decided to finish off a woodland musical instrument project for his kids, and one evening used "the tree guitar" to write Gruffalo Blues. A number of recording sessions were then held in the area, including drop-in events for anyone wishing to come along and sing. Out of these sessions the Leith Hill Community Blues Band was born.</p>

<p>We're asking the Gruffalo to join us in reminding the Forestry Commission that they need to honour their <a href="https://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-6val65" target="_blank">their corporate mission statement</a> to protect our forests and woodlands, and desist in selling them off to the fossil fuel industry, and that they should be showing more leadership in the critically important task of helping the country meet its climate change targets.
