<h3>Gruffalo Blues (Save Leith Hill) - Lyrics</h3>

<p>I'm gonna tell you a story<br>
About a beautiful old hill<br>
And how the bad man's coming<br>
With his dirty oil drill<br>
Pumping acid in the water<br>
And poisoning the land<br>
All for the sake of an extra<br>
Couple of coins in his hand</p>

<p>Gruffalo we're asking<br>
Have nothing more to do<br>
With the Forestry Commission<br>
Please we're begging you<br>
Cos they sold our hill to the bad man<br>
And couldn't give two hoots<br>
Please spread the word to all your friends,<br>
Tell Julia and Axel too</p>

<p>Hey Mr Gruffalo<br>
Have nothing more to do<br>
With the Forestry Commission<br>
Please we're begging you<br>
Cos they sold our hill to the bad man<br>
With his dirty oil drill<br>
Help us Mr Gruffalo<br>
Save lovely Leith Hill</p>

<p>Hey Mr Gruffalo<br>
Have nothing more to do<br>
With the Forestry Commission<br>
Please we're begging you<br>
Cos the bad man is coming<br>
With his filthy oil drill<br>
We've got to stop him now<br>
Before our kids all end up ill</p>

<p>Help us Mr Gruffalo<br>
Help us Mr Gruffalo<br>
Help us Mr Gruffalo<br>
Save our hill</p>
